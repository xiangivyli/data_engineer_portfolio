Data Cleansing:
1. courses.csv keep module BBB;
2. assessments.csv keep module BBB;
3. vle.csv keep module BBB and valid week_from, week_to (remove blanks);
4. studentInfo.csv keep module BBB;
5. studentRegistration.csv keep module BBB;
6. studentAssessment.csv merge() adds code_module from assessments.csv, then keep module BBB;
7. studentVle.csv Python filters module BBB and aggragates sum_clicks together for the same code_module, same code_presentation, same id_student, same id_site and same date (reason 1: can not distinguish records which are only different in sum_click; reason 2: save memory)
